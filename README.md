# Day Planner
Welcome to our day planner application! This is a great web application to organize your daily to do list at work!

Our day planner app will tell you todays date so you can be sure you are on the right day.

The day planner is based on a 9 to 5 work day and allows you to detail tasks for each hour of your work day. Once you have typed your task into the corresponding hour hit the save button to save the task locally. 

You will notice that the current hour will highlight the color green and each hour that has passed will turn red. We did this too help you stay on top of what tasks you have planned!

Our planner operates in your web browser!
